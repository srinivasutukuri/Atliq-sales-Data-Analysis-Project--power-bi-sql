# Power-BI-Sales-Data-Analysis-Project

Problem Statement
You have a dataset containing sales data for Atliq Hardware spanning four years (2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020). The issue at hand is a significant revenue increase of nearly 300% in the year 2018, followed by a consistent decline in revenue in the subsequent years. The primary objectives of this project are to identify the reasons behind the steep revenue drop and understand what factors contributed to the exceptional 300% increase in revenue within a single year.

Solution
In this project, SQL was utilized for data cleaning and analysis, with some additional data cleaning performed in Power BI. We aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of the dataset to gain insights into the revenue patterns and factors influencing it.
